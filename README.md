# LEDSerial
### Collection of software for communicating with and controlling individually addressable LED strips

Organized as follows

* arduino - sketch file for arduino controller
* ledcomm - golang library for communicating with arduino controller
* ledmain - sample client for controlling led strip, includes demos
* ledscreen - sample client that projects the screen colors on the led strip

## Installing

With go installed, just run

`go get github.com/pato/LEDserial/ledcomm`

`go get github.com/pato/LEDserial/ledmain`

`go get github.com/pato/LEDserial/ledscreen`

And they will be built in `$GOPATH/bin`

### arduino/SerialSlave

The simplest part of the system, it keeps an internal representation of the LED strip's colors
and supports three commands which are remotely called through a raw serial buffer.

`f` - 1 byte command to flush the internal representation through to the led strip

`c` - 1 byte clear the internal representation of colors and flush it

`s|r|g|b|i` - 5 byte command update a single led in the internal representation. r,g,b,i are 8bit values which
represent the red, green, blue components of the color, and the led index in strip.

In uses the [PololuLedStrip](https://github.com/pololu/pololu-led-strip-arduino) library for communicating with the
LED strip.

The arduino software makes no guarantees about timing or integrity, it plainly read and executes.

### ledcomm

Golang library for communicating with the arduino

### ledmain

Golang client demo of ledcomm libraries. Can be used to send individual commands to strip

![ledmain](http://plankenau.com/i/kmv3AE.gif)

To clear strip

`ledmain -clear`

To send red to the 5th led

`ledmain -send -r 255 -g 0 -b 0 -i 5`

To send an HSV color to the 5th led

`ledmain -send -h 300 -s 1 -v 255 -i 5`

To run the fourth demo at full brightness

`ledmain -demo -n 4 -brightness 255`

To get the usage help

`ledmain -help`

### ledscreen

Golang client that takes the pixels of the screen, averages them into 60 buckets and sends the colors
to the LED strip: acts like an ambient light system.

To start

`ledscreen`

### Compatability

Only tested on linux x64; ledcomm expects /dev directory convention for communicating over tty and ledscreen
depends on linux bindings.
